-   `___ unit in blah.`: e.g., 0.3 cm in thickness.

-   `Size = ___ `: e.g.
    -   **Isthmus:** Thickness = 2.0 mm. 

-   `object, measuring ___ unit`: e.g.

## Uncertain amount

-   `[a few | several | innumerable]` + pleural countable n. (e.g., a few cysts)

-   `[small | large]` amount of + uncountable n. (e.g., small amount of free fluid)
